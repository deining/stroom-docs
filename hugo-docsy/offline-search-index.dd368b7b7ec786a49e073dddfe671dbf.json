Kubeflow has a great example.\nDon’t forget to link to your own doc repo rather than our example site! Also make sure users can find these guidelines from your doc repo README: either add them there and link to them from this page, add them here and link to them from the README, or include them in both locations.\n We use Hugo to format and generate our website, the Docsy theme for styling and site structure, and Netlify to manage the deployment of the site. Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.\nQuick start with Netlify Here’s a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you’re familiar with the GitHub workflow and you’re happy to use the automated preview of your doc updates:\n Fork the Goldydocs repo on GitHub. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR). If you’re not yet ready for a review, add “WIP” to the PR name to indicate it’s a work in progress. (Don’t add the Hugo property “draft = true” to the page front matter, because that prevents the auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.) Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it’s ready, you should see a comment like this: deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready! Click Details to the right of “Deploy preview ready” to see a preview of your updates. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you’re happy with the content. When you’re ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any “WIP” markers.  Updating a single page If you’ve just spotted something you’d like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:\n Click Edit this page in the top right hand corner of the page. If you don’t already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click Fork this repository and propose changes or Update your Fork to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode. Follow the rest of the Quick start with Netlify process above to make, preview, and propose your changes.  Previewing your changes locally If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:\n  Follow the instructions in Getting started to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You’ll need at least Hugo version 0.45 (we recommend using the most recent available version), and it must be the extended version, which supports SCSS.\n  Fork the Goldydocs repo repo into your own project, then create a local copy using git clone. Don’t forget to use --recurse-submodules or you won’t pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.\ngit clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git   Run hugo server in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you’re serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.\n  Continue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.\n  Creating an issue If you’ve found a problem in the docs, but you’re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the Goldydocs repo. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the Create Issue button in the top right hand corner of the page.\nUseful resources  Docsy user guide: All about Docsy, including how it manages navigation, look and feel, and multi-language support.

This simplifies the installation and configuration of stroom.\nConfiguration Properties Improvements Configuration is now provided by YAML files on boot Previously stroom used a flat .conf file to manage the application configuration. Application logging was configured either via a .yml file (in v6) or in an .xml file (in v5). Now stroom uses a single .yml file to configure the application and logging. This file is different to the .yml files(s) used in the docker compose configuration. The YAML file provides a more logical hierarchical structure and support for typed values (longs, doubles, maps, lists, etc.).\nThe YAML configuration is intended for configuration items that are either needed to bootstrap stroom or have values that are specific to a node. Cluster wide configuration properties are still stored in the database and managed via the UI.\nThere has been a change to the precedence of the configuration properties held in different locations (YAML, database, default) and this is described in Properties.\nStroom Home and relative paths The concept of Stroom Home has been introduced. Stroom Home allows for one path to be configured and for all other configurable paths to default to being a child of this path. This keeps all configured directories in one place by default. Each configured directory can be set to an absolute path if a location outside Stroom Home is required. If a relative path is used it will be relative to Stroom Home. Stroom Home can be configured with the property stroom.path.home.\nImproved Properties UI screens that tell you the values over the cluster Previously the Properties UI screens could only tell you the values held within the database and not the value that a node was actually using. The Properties screens have been improved to tell you the source of a property value and where multiple values exist across the cluster, which nodes have what values. See Properties.\nValidation of Configuration Property Values Validation of configuration property values is now possible. The validation rules are defined in the application code and allow for things like:\n Ensuring that a regex pattern is a valid pattern Setting maximum or minimum values to numeric properties. Ensuring a property has a value.  Validation will be enforced on application boot or when a value is edited via the UI.\nHot Loading of Node Configuration Now that node specific configuration is managed via the YAML configuration file stroom will detect changes to this file and update the configuration properties accordingly. Some properties however do not support being changed at runtime so will still require either the whole system or the UI nodes to be restarted.\nData retention impact summary The Data_Retention screen now provides an Impact Summary tab that will show you a summary of what will be deleted by the current active rules. The summary is based on the rules as they currently are in the UI, so it allows you to see the impact before saving rule changes. The summary is a count of the number of streams that will be deleted by each rule, broken down by feed and stream type. In very large systems with a lot of data or where complex rules are in place the summary may take a some time (minutes) to produce.\nSee Data Retention for more details.\nFuzzy Finding in Quick Filters and Suggestion Text Fields A richer fuzzy find algorithm has been added to the Quick filter search fields. It has also been added to some text input fields with suggestion fields, e.g. Feed Name input fields. This makes finding values or rows in a table faster and more precise.\nSee Finding Things for more details.\nNew (off-heap) memory efficient reference data The reference data feature in previous versions of stroom loaded the reference data on demand and held it in Java’s heap memory. In large systems or where a pipeline doing reference data lookups across a wide time range this can lead to very large heap sizes.\nIn v7 stroom now uses an off-heap, disk backed store (LMDB) for the reference data. This removes all (with the exception of context lookups) from the Java heap, so the -Xmx value can be reduced. In large systems this can mean keeping your -Xmx value below the 32Gb threshold to further reduce the memory usage. Because the store is disk backed frequently used reference data can be kept in the store to reduce the loading overhead. As the reference data is held off-heap it stroom can make use of all available free RAM for the reference data.\nSee Reference Data\nReference Data API A RESTful API has been added for the reference data store. This primarily allows reference lookups to be performed by external systems.\nSee Reference Data API\nText editor improvements The Ace text editor is used widely in Stroom for such things as editing XSLTs, editing dashboard column expressions, viewing stream data and stepping. There have been a number of improvements to this editor.\nSee Editing and Viewing Text Data\nEditor context menu Additional options have been added to the context menu in the text editor:\n Toggle soft line wrapping of long lines. Toggle viewing hidden characters, e.g. tabs, spaces, line breaks. Toggle Vim key bindings. The Ace editor does not implement all Vim functionality but supports the core key bindings. Toggle auto-completion. Completion is triggered using ctrl-space. Toggle live auto-completion. Completion is triggered as you type. Toggle the inclusion of snippets in the auto-complete suggestions.  Auto-completion and snippets Most editor screens now support basic auto-completion of existing words found in the text. Some editor screens, such as XSLT, dashboard column expressions and Javascript scripts also support keyword and snippet completion.\nData viewing improvements The way data is viewed in Stroom has changed to improve the viewing of large files or files with no line breaks. Previously a set number of lines of data would be fetched for display on the page in the Data Viewer. This did not work for data that has no line breaks as Stroom would then try to fetch all data.\nIn v7 Stroom works at the character level so can fetch a reasonable number of characters for display whether they are all one line or spread over multiple lines.\nThe viewing of data has been separated into two mechanisms, Data Preview and Source View.\nSee Editing and Viewing Text Data\nData Preview This is the default view of the data. It displays the first n characters (configurable) of the data. It will attempt the format the data, e.g. showing pretty-printed XML. You cannot navigate around the data.\nSource View This view is intended for seeing the actual data in its raw un-formatted form and for navigating around it. This view provides navigation controls to define the range of data being display, e.g. from a character offset, line number or line and column.\nYou can now query data, server tasks and processing tasks on dashboards TODO Complete this section  Data actions such as delete, download, reprocess now provide an impact summary before proceeding. TODO Complete this section  Index volume groups for easier index volume assignment TODO Complete this section  Kafka Integration New Kafka Configuration Entity Integration with Apache Kafka was introduced in v6 however the way the connection to Kafka cluster(s) is configured has been improved. We have introduced a new entity type called Kafka Configuration that can be created/managed via the explorer tree. This means stroom can integrate with many Kafka clusters or connect to a cluster using different sets of Kafka Configuration properties. The Kafka Configuration entity provides an editor for setting all the Kafka specific configuration properties. Pipeline elements that use Kafka now provide a means to select the Kafka Configuration to use.\nTODO Add user guide section on Kafka configuration  An Improved Pipeline Element for Sending Data to Kafka The previous Kafka pipeline elements in v6 have been replaced with a single StandardKafkaProducer element. The new element allows for the dynamic construction of a Kafka Producer message via an XML document conforming to the kafka-records XmlSchema. With this new element events can be translated into kafka records which will be then given to the Kafka Producer to send to the Kafka Cluster. This allows for complete control of things like timestamps, topics, keys, values, etc.\nTODO Add user guide section on Kafka Standard Producer  No limitations on data reprocessing TODO Complete this section  Improved REST API A rich REST API for all UI accessible functions The architecture of the stroom UI has been changed such that all communication between the UI and the back end is via REST calls. This means all of these REST calls are available as an API for users of stroom to take advantage of. It opens up the possibility for interacting with stoom via scripts or from other applications.\nSwagger UI to document REST API methods The Swagger UI and specification file have been improved to include all of the API methods available in stroom.\nImproved architecture with separate modules with individual DB access to spread load. The architecture of the core stroom application has been fundamentally changed in v7 to internally break up the application into its functional areas. This separation makes for a more logical code base and allows for the possibility of each functional area having its own database instance, if required.\nJava 12 stroom v7 now runs on the Java 12 JVM.\nMySQL 8 support. stroom v7 has been changed to support MySQL v8, opening up the possibility of using features like group replication.\n","categories":"","description":"This is my heading\n","excerpt":"This is my heading\n","ref":"/stroom-docs/hugo-docsy/news/releases/v07.00/","tags":"","title":"Version 7.0"},{"body":" TODO Version 6.1 release notes need populating.

This change allows support for broader corporate authentication schemes and is a key requirement for enabling the future microservice architecture for Stroom.\nAPI keys for third party clients Anyone wishing to make use of the data exposed by Stroom’s services can request an API key. This key acts as a password for their own applications. It allows administrators to secure and manage access to Stroom’s data.\nHBase backed statistics store This new implementation of statistics (Stroom-Stats) provides a vastly more scalable time series DB for large scale collection of Stroom’s data aggregated to various time buckets. Stroom-Stats uses Kafka for ingesting the source data.\nData receipt filtering Data arriving in Stroom has meta data that can be matched against a policy so that certain actions can be taken. This could be to receive, drop or reject the data.\nFiltering of data also applies to Stroom proxy where each proxy can get a filtering policy from an upstream proxy or a Stroom instance.\nData retention policies The length of time that data will be retained in Strooms stream store can be defined by creating data retention rules. These rules match streams based on their meta data and will automatically delete data once the retention period associated with the rule is exceeded.\nDashboard linking Links can be created in dashboards to jump to other dashboards or other external sites that provide additional contextual information.\nSearch API The search system used by Dashboards can be used via a restful API. This provides access to data stored in search indices (including the ability to extract data) and statistics stores. The data fetched via the search API can be received and processed via an external system.\nKafka appender and filter New pipeline elements for writing XML or text data to a Kafka topic. This provides more options for using Stroom’s data in other systems.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect authentication Authentication for Stroom …","ref":"/stroom-docs/hugo-docsy/news/releases/v06.00/","tags":"","title":"Version 6.0"},{"body":"This is a typical blog post that includes images.\nThe front matter specifies the date of the blog post, its title, a short description that will be displayed on the blog landing page, and its author.\nIncluding images Here’s an image (featured-sunset-get.png) that includes a byline and a caption.\nFetch and scale an image in the upcoming Hugo 0.43.
