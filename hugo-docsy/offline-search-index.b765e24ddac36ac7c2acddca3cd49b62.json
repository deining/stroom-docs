You can use the guidelines “as is” or adapt them with your own instructions: for example, other deployment options, information about your doc project’s file structure, project-specific review guidelines, versioning guidelines, or any other information your users might find useful when updating your site. Kubeflow has a great example.\nDon’t forget to link to your own doc repo rather than our example site! Also make sure users can find these guidelines from your doc repo README: either add them there and link to them from this page, add them here and link to them from the README, or include them in both locations.\n We use Hugo to format and generate our website, the Docsy theme for styling and site structure, and Netlify to manage the deployment of the site. Hugo is an open-source static site generator that provides us with templates, content organisation in a standard directory structure, and a website generation engine. You write the pages in Markdown (or HTML if you want), and Hugo wraps them up into a website.\nAll submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult GitHub Help for more information on using pull requests.\nQuick start with Netlify Here’s a quick guide to updating the docs. It assumes you’re familiar with the GitHub workflow and you’re happy to use the automated preview of your doc updates:\n Fork the Goldydocs repo on GitHub. Make your changes and send a pull request (PR). If you’re not yet ready for a review, add “WIP” to the PR name to indicate it’s a work in progress. (Don’t add the Hugo property “draft = true” to the page front matter, because that prevents the auto-deployment of the content preview described in the next point.) Wait for the automated PR workflow to do some checks. When it’s ready, you should see a comment like this: deploy/netlify — Deploy preview ready! Click Details to the right of “Deploy preview ready” to see a preview of your updates. Continue updating your doc and pushing your changes until you’re happy with the content. When you’re ready for a review, add a comment to the PR, and remove any “WIP” markers.  Updating a single page If you’ve just spotted something you’d like to change while using the docs, Docsy has a shortcut for you:\n Click Edit this page in the top right hand corner of the page. If you don’t already have an up to date fork of the project repo, you are prompted to get one - click Fork this repository and propose changes or Update your Fork to get an up to date version of the project to edit. The appropriate page in your fork is displayed in edit mode. Follow the rest of the Quick start with Netlify process above to make, preview, and propose your changes.  Previewing your changes locally If you want to run your own local Hugo server to preview your changes as you work:\n  Follow the instructions in Getting started to install Hugo and any other tools you need. You’ll need at least Hugo version 0.45 (we recommend using the most recent available version), and it must be the extended version, which supports SCSS.\n  Fork the Goldydocs repo repo into your own project, then create a local copy using git clone. Don’t forget to use --recurse-submodules or you won’t pull down some of the code you need to generate a working site.\ngit clone --recurse-submodules --depth 1 https://github.com/google/docsy-example.git   Run hugo server in the site root directory. By default your site will be available at http://localhost:1313/. Now that you’re serving your site locally, Hugo will watch for changes to the content and automatically refresh your site.\n  Continue with the usual GitHub workflow to edit files, commit them, push the changes up to your fork, and create a pull request.\n  Creating an issue If you’ve found a problem in the docs, but you’re not sure how to fix it yourself, please create an issue in the Goldydocs repo. You can also create an issue about a specific page by clicking the Create Issue button in the top right hand corner of the page.\nUseful resources  Docsy user guide: All about Docsy, including how it manages navigation, look and feel, and multi-language support.

Typically you’re going to want to do a lot of the same stuff for every pipeline, i.e. similar transformations, indexing, writing out data. You can actually create a template pipeline and inherit from it, tweaking what you need to for this or that feed. We’re not doing that now because we want to show how to create one from scratch.\n Create a pipeline by right-clicking our Stroom 101 folder. Call it something like CSV to XML pipeline. Select Structure from the top of the new tab. This is the most important view for the pipeline because it shows what will actually happen on the pipeline. Check Advanced Mode so that we can actually edit things.  We already have a Source element. Unlike most other pipeline elements this isn’t something we need to configure. It’s just there to show the starting point. Data gets into the pipeline via other means - we’ll describe this in detail later.\nAdd a data splitter Data splitters are powerful, and a lot we can say about them. Here we’re just going to make a basic one.\nCreate a CSV splitter We have CSV in the following form:\nid,guid,from_ip,to_ip,application 1,10990cde-1084-4006-aaf3-7fe52b62ce06,159.161.108.105,217.151.32.69,Tres-Zap 2,633aa1a8-04ff-442d-ad9a-03ce9166a63a,210.14.34.58,133.136.48.23,Sub-Ex To process this we need to know if there’s a header row, and what the delimiters are. This is a job for a Data Splitter.\nThe splitter is actually a type of Text Converter, so lets create one of those:\nCall it something like CSV splitter. In the new tab you need to tell the Text Converter that it’ll be a Data Splitter:\nNow go to the Conversion tab. What you need to put in here is specific to the built-in Data Splitter functionality, so I’m just going to tell you what you’re going to need:\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.1\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?\u003e \u003cdataSplitter xmlns=\"data-splitter:3\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" xsi:schemaLocation=\"data-splitter:3 file://data-splitter-v3.0.1.xsd\" version=\"3.0\"\u003e \u003c!-- The first line contains the field names --\u003e \u003csplit delimiter=\"\\n\" maxMatch=\"1\"\u003e \u003cgroup\u003e \u003csplit delimiter=\",\" containerStart=\"\u0026#34;\" containerEnd=\"\u0026#34;\"\u003e \u003cvar id=\"heading\" /\u003e \u003c/split\u003e \u003c/group\u003e \u003c/split\u003e \u003c!-- All subsequent lines are records --\u003e \u003csplit delimiter=\"\\n\"\u003e \u003cgroup\u003e \u003csplit delimiter=\",\" containerStart=\"\u0026#34;\" containerEnd=\"\u0026#34;\"\u003e \u003cdata name=\"$heading$1\" value=\"$1\" /\u003e \u003c/split\u003e \u003c/group\u003e \u003c/split\u003e \u003c/dataSplitter\u003e You can see that it uses the data-splitter-v3.0.1.xsd that we imported earlier. Save it by clicking the save icon ().\nSo we now have a configured, re-usable data splitter for CSV files that have headers. We need to add this to our pipeline as a filter, so head back to the pipeline’s Structure section and add a DSParser, as below. Call it something like CSV splitter filter: Now we have a pipeline that looks like this:\nClick on the CSV splitter filter element and the pane below will show it’s properties. We need to tell it to use our newly created CSV splitter. Double click the textConverter property and change Value to the actual CSV splitter:\nTest the csv splitter So now we have CSV data in Stroom and a pipeline that is configured to process CSV data. We’ve done a fair few things so far and are we sure the pipeline is correctly configured? We can do some debugging and find out.\nIn Stroom you can step through you records and see what the output is at each stage. It’s easy to start doing this. The first thing to do is to open your CSV_FEED feed, then click the big blue stepping button at the bottom right:\nYou’ll be asked to select a pipeline:\nNow you get a view that’s similar to your feed view, except it also shows the pipeline:\nIt also has stepping controls. Click the green step forward icon (). You should see something like this:\nGreat! If you don’t see this then there’s something wrong. Click on CSV splitter filter. You’ll see the conversion code and hopefully some errors. Some issues might be: did you remember to import the data splitter schema into Stroom? Did you remember to confgure the Text Converter to be a Data Splitter?\nIf everything went fine then click the step forward button a few more times and you’ll see the yellow selection move down as you process each row.\nWhat we actually want to see is the output from the Text Converter, so click on CSV splitter filter. You’ll see the conversion code we entered earlier and below two panes, one containing the CSV and one containing the split-up text, in XML form:\nSo here we have some XML in a basic format we call the records format. You can see the schema for records in the XML schemas folder.\nAdd XSLT to transform records format XML into something else Create the XSLT filter This process is very similar to creating the CSV splitter:\n Create the XSLT filter Add it to the pipeline Step through to make sure it’s doing what we expect  Create the XSLT filter, calling it something like XSLT:\nOn the new tab click on XSLT. This is another big text field but this one accepts XSLT. This one will be very basic and just takes the split up data and puts it into fields. The XSLT for this is below but if you’d like to tinker then go ahead.\n\u003c?xml version=\"1.1\" encoding=\"UTF-8\" ?\u003e \u003cxsl:stylesheet xpath-default-namespace=\"records:2\" xmlns:stroom=\"stroom\" xmlns:xsl=\"http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform\" xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" version=\"2.0\"\u003e \u003cxsl:template match=\"records\"\u003e \u003cEvents\u003e \u003cxsl:apply-templates /\u003e \u003c/Events\u003e \u003c/xsl:template\u003e \u003cxsl:template match=\"record\"\u003e \u003cxsl:variable name=\"id\" select=\"data[@name='id']/@value\" /\u003e \u003cxsl:variable name=\"guid\" select=\"data[@name='guid']/@value\" /\u003e \u003cxsl:variable name=\"from_ip\" select=\"data[@name='from_ip']/@value\" /\u003e \u003cxsl:variable name=\"to_ip\" select=\"data[@name='to_ip']/@value\" /\u003e \u003cxsl:variable name=\"application\" select=\"data[@name='application']/@value\" /\u003e \u003cEvent\u003e \u003cId\u003e\u003cxsl:value-of select=\"$id\" /\u003e\u003c/Id\u003e \u003cGuid\u003e\u003cxsl:value-of select=\"$guid\" /\u003e\u003c/Guid\u003e \u003cFromIp\u003e\u003cxsl:value-of select=\"$from_ip\" /\u003e\u003c/FromIp\u003e \u003cToIp\u003e\u003cxsl:value-of select=\"$to_ip\" /\u003e\u003c/ToIp\u003e \u003cApplication\u003e\u003cxsl:value-of select=\"$application\" /\u003e\u003c/Application\u003e \u003c/Event\u003e \u003c/xsl:template\u003e \u003c/xsl:stylesheet\u003e Make sure you save it.\nGo back to the Structure section of the pipeline and add an XSLTFilter element. Call it something like XSLT filter.\nSelect the XSLT filter and configure it to use the actual XSLT you just created by double-clicking xslt in the properties:\nIn the dialog make sure the value is the XSLT filter. Save the pipeline.\nTest the XSLT filter We’re going to test this in the same way we tested the CSV splitter, by clicking the big blue button on the feed. Click the step forward button () a few times to make sure it’s working then click on the XSLT element. This time you should see the XSLT filter there too, as well as the basic XML being transformed into more useful XML:\nFantastic! Data converted! Well done if you’ve got this far. Really, there are lots of steps and things that could go wrong and you’ve persevered. There’s a few more things to get this pipeline ready for doing this task for real. We need to get this data to a destination.\nOutputting the transformed data Create the XML writer What’s an XML Writer and why do you need one? The XSLT filter doesn’t actually write XML but instead just passes XML events from one filter to another. In order to write XML out you need an XML writer. You don’t need to create one outside the pipeline (in the way you did with the CSV splitter and the XSLT filter). An XML writer is just added to the pipeline like this:\nThat’s it, no other configuration necessary.\nCreate the destination We need to do something with the serialised XML. We’ll write it to a stream. To do this we create a stream appender:\nUnlike the Source element this element needs to be configured. We need to configure two things: the streamType and the destination feed.\nSetting the feed We’ll send the output to the CSV_FEED - all data associated with this feed will be in the same place. To do that we edit the feed property and set it to CSV_FEED:\nWe also need to edit the streamType property:We set the streamType to Events:\nThat’s it! Our pipeline is configured!\nTest the destination We can test the XML writer and the streamAppender using the same stepping feature. Make sure you’ve saved the pipeline and set a new stepping session running. If you click on the stream appender you’ll see something like this:\nSet the pipeline running Obviously you don’t want to step through your data one by one. This all needs automation, and this is what Processors are for. The processor works in the background to take any unprocessed data from a feed and put it through a pipeline. So far everything on our EXAMPLE_IN feed is unprocessed.\nCreate a processor Processors are created from the Processors section of the pipeline:\nClick the add button and configure the huge dialog. You only need to set the incoming feed and the stream types:\n(Now you’ll see a very wide table looking something like this:\nThis shows two things:\n The processor for the pipeline The filter that determines what data is passed to the processor  If you scroll all the way over to the right you’ll see the Enabled checkbox:\nCheck enabled for the processor and the filter you’ve just created. This is it, everything we’ve done is about to start working on its own, just like it would in a real configuration.\nIf you keep refreshing this table it will show you the processing status which should change after a few seconds to show that the data you have uploaded is being or has been processed. Once this has happened you should be able to open the destination feed and see the output data (or errors if there were any).\nYou can see that there are the Raw Events and the processed Events. If you click on the Events then you can see all the XML that we’ve produced.\nTroubleshooting If nothing happens you might need to enable stream processing. This was explained earlier.\nNow you’ve processed your data you can go ahead and index it.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Create a pipeline Pipelines control how data is processed in Stroom. …","ref":"/stroom-docs/hugo-docsy/docs/quick-start-guide/process/","tags":["processing"],"title":"Pipeline Processing"},{"body":"Before you can visualise your data with dashboards you have to index the data; First I opted for creating a specific volume to hold my data, just because I wanted to keep my shards away from the default volumes;\nGo to the Tools ➔ Volumes menu\nOnce the volumes dialogue opens click the blue plus sign at the top left of the window to add a new one\nSelect the node where you want the volume to be and the path you want to create, (because we are following the quick-start guide we just have one node and limited size, but we do want to set it as active so we can write documents to it and we want it to be public, because we might want other indexes to use it; your needs might be different.\nClick ok and we’re good to go.\nThen we can create an index by selecting index item in the explorer tree.

The count is updated on shard flush and happens in the background.\nNow that we have finished indexing we can display data on a dashboard.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"Before you can visualise your data with dashboards you have to index …","ref":"/stroom-docs/hugo-docsy/docs/quick-start-guide/index/","tags":["index"],"title":"Indexing"},{"body":"Create a new dashboard the same way you create anything else\nOn the query pane click the settings () button on the top right of the panel.\nChoose the index you just created as your data source.\nNow add a term to the query to get a handle on the data\nFor our simple example we’re using a wildcard that captures all documents with an Id set.\nWithin the table panel we now need to set a few defaults. On the table pane click the settings () button on the top right of the panel. Extract Values needs to be ticked. If grouping is to be used and the content of the groups is to be viewed then Show Group Detail should also be ticked. The Maximum Results field may also be changed from default if required to limit the results or if more results are expected than the default value. Be aware that setting this value too high may result in excessive memory being used by the query process though.\nWe now need to select a pipeline to display the results in the table by setting Extraction Pipeline. The simplest way is to create and save a new pipeline based on the existing Search Extraction template pipeline. Within this new pipeline, use either the XSLT used for indexing the data or preferably a copy of this XSLT saved elsewhere. The extraction pipeline and the dashboard itself should then be saved.\nIn the table panel we can add the fields we are interested in, in this case we wanted to sort the application field and count how many time the application name appears.\nIf at this point, we decide that we’d like to see additional fields in the table extracted from each record then the Extraction Pipeline XSLT can be modified to extract them from the Event:\n... \u003cxsl:template match=\"/xpath/to/usefulField\"\u003e \u003cdata name=\"UsefulField\"\u003e \u003cxsl:attribute name=\"value\" select=\"text()\" /\u003e \u003c/data\u003e \u003c/xsl:template\u003e ...

This simplifies the installation and configuration of stroom.\nConfiguration Properties Improvements Configuration is now provided by YAML files on boot Previously stroom used a flat .conf file to manage the application configuration. Application logging was configured either via a .yml file (in v6) or in an .xml file (in v5). Now stroom uses a single .yml file to configure the application and logging. This file is different to the .yml files(s) used in the docker compose configuration. The YAML file provides a more logical hierarchical structure and support for typed values (longs, doubles, maps, lists, etc.).\nThe YAML configuration is intended for configuration items that are either needed to bootstrap stroom or have values that are specific to a node. Cluster wide configuration properties are still stored in the database and managed via the UI.\nThere has been a change to the precedence of the configuration properties held in different locations (YAML, database, default) and this is described in Properties.\nStroom Home and relative paths The concept of Stroom Home has been introduced. Stroom Home allows for one path to be configured and for all other configurable paths to default to being a child of this path. This keeps all configured directories in one place by default. Each configured directory can be set to an absolute path if a location outside Stroom Home is required. If a relative path is used it will be relative to Stroom Home. Stroom Home can be configured with the property stroom.path.home.\nImproved Properties UI screens that tell you the values over the cluster Previously the Properties UI screens could only tell you the values held within the database and not the value that a node was actually using. The Properties screens have been improved to tell you the source of a property value and where multiple values exist across the cluster, which nodes have what values. See Properties.\nValidation of Configuration Property Values Validation of configuration property values is now possible. The validation rules are defined in the application code and allow for things like:\n Ensuring that a regex pattern is a valid pattern Setting maximum or minimum values to numeric properties. Ensuring a property has a value.  Validation will be enforced on application boot or when a value is edited via the UI.\nHot Loading of Node Configuration Now that node specific configuration is managed via the YAML configuration file stroom will detect changes to this file and update the configuration properties accordingly. Some properties however do not support being changed at runtime so will still require either the whole system or the UI nodes to be restarted.\nData retention impact summary The Data_Retention screen now provides an Impact Summary tab that will show you a summary of what will be deleted by the current active rules. The summary is based on the rules as they currently are in the UI, so it allows you to see the impact before saving rule changes. The summary is a count of the number of streams that will be deleted by each rule, broken down by feed and stream type. In very large systems with a lot of data or where complex rules are in place the summary may take a some time (minutes) to produce.\nSee Data Retention for more details.\nFuzzy Finding in Quick Filters and Suggestion Text Fields A richer fuzzy find algorithm has been added to the Quick filter search fields. It has also been added to some text input fields with suggestion fields, e.g. Feed Name input fields. This makes finding values or rows in a table faster and more precise.\nSee Finding Things for more details.\nNew (off-heap) memory efficient reference data The reference data feature in previous versions of stroom loaded the reference data on demand and held it in Java’s heap memory. In large systems or where a pipeline doing reference data lookups across a wide time range this can lead to very large heap sizes.\nIn v7 stroom now uses an off-heap, disk backed store (LMDB) for the reference data. This removes all (with the exception of context lookups) from the Java heap, so the -Xmx value can be reduced. In large systems this can mean keeping your -Xmx value below the 32Gb threshold to further reduce the memory usage. Because the store is disk backed frequently used reference data can be kept in the store to reduce the loading overhead. As the reference data is held off-heap it stroom can make use of all available free RAM for the reference data.\nSee Reference Data\nReference Data API A RESTful API has been added for the reference data store. This primarily allows reference lookups to be performed by external systems.\nSee Reference Data API\nText editor improvements The Ace text editor is used widely in Stroom for such things as editing XSLTs, editing dashboard column expressions, viewing stream data and stepping. There have been a number of improvements to this editor.\nSee Editing and Viewing Text Data\nEditor context menu Additional options have been added to the context menu in the text editor:\n Toggle soft line wrapping of long lines. Toggle viewing hidden characters, e.g. tabs, spaces, line breaks. Toggle Vim key bindings. The Ace editor does not implement all Vim functionality but supports the core key bindings.

Auto-completion and snippets Most editor screens now support basic auto-completion of existing words found in the text. Some editor screens, such as XSLT, dashboard column expressions and Javascript scripts also support keyword and snippet completion.\nData viewing improvements The way data is viewed in Stroom has changed to improve the viewing of large files or files with no line breaks. Previously a set number of lines of data would be fetched for display on the page in the Data Viewer. This did not work for data that has no line breaks as Stroom would then try to fetch all data.\nIn v7 Stroom works at the character level so can fetch a reasonable number of characters for display whether they are all one line or spread over multiple lines.\nThe viewing of data has been separated into two mechanisms, Data Preview and Source View.\nSee Editing and Viewing Text Data\nData Preview This is the default view of the data. It displays the first n characters (configurable) of the data. It will attempt the format the data, e.g. showing pretty-printed XML. You cannot navigate around the data.\nSource View This view is intended for seeing the actual data in its raw un-formatted form and for navigating around it. This view provides navigation controls to define the range of data being display, e.g. from a character offset, line number or line and column.\nYou can now query data, server tasks and processing tasks on dashboards TODO Complete this section  Data actions such as delete, download, reprocess now provide an impact summary before proceeding. TODO Complete this section  Index volume groups for easier index volume assignment TODO Complete this section  Kafka Integration New Kafka Configuration Entity Integration with Apache Kafka was introduced in v6 however the way the connection to Kafka cluster(s) is configured has been improved. We have introduced a new entity type called Kafka Configuration that can be created/managed via the explorer tree. This means stroom can integrate with many Kafka clusters or connect to a cluster using different sets of Kafka Configuration properties. The Kafka Configuration entity provides an editor for setting all the Kafka specific configuration properties. Pipeline elements that use Kafka now provide a means to select the Kafka Configuration to use.\nTODO Add user guide section on Kafka configuration  An Improved Pipeline Element for Sending Data to Kafka The previous Kafka pipeline elements in v6 have been replaced with a single StandardKafkaProducer element. The new element allows for the dynamic construction of a Kafka Producer message via an XML document conforming to the kafka-records XmlSchema. With this new element events can be translated into kafka records which will be then given to the Kafka Producer to send to the Kafka Cluster. This allows for complete control of things like timestamps, topics, keys, values, etc.\nTODO Add user guide section on Kafka Standard Producer  No limitations on data reprocessing TODO Complete this section  Improved REST API A rich REST API for all UI accessible functions The architecture of the stroom UI has been changed such that all communication between the UI and the back end is via REST calls. This means all of these REST calls are available as an API for users of stroom to take advantage of. It opens up the possibility for interacting with stoom via scripts or from other applications.\nSwagger UI to document REST API methods The Swagger UI and specification file have been improved to include all of the API methods available in stroom.\nImproved architecture with separate modules with individual DB access to spread load. The architecture of the core stroom application has been fundamentally changed in v7 to internally break up the application into its functional areas. This separation makes for a more logical code base and allows for the possibility of each functional area having its own database instance, if required.\nJava 12 stroom v7 now runs on the Java 12 JVM.\nMySQL 8 support. stroom v7 has been changed to support MySQL v8, opening up the possibility of using features like group replication.\n","categories":"","description":"This is my heading\n","excerpt":"This is my heading\n","ref":"/stroom-docs/hugo-docsy/news/releases/v07.00/","tags":"","title":"Version 7.0"},{"body":" TODO Version 6.1 release notes need populating.

This change allows support for broader corporate authentication schemes and is a key requirement for enabling the future microservice architecture for Stroom.\nAPI keys for third party clients Anyone wishing to make use of the data exposed by Stroom’s services can request an API key. This key acts as a password for their own applications. It allows administrators to secure and manage access to Stroom’s data.\nHBase backed statistics store This new implementation of statistics (Stroom-Stats) provides a vastly more scalable time series DB for large scale collection of Stroom’s data aggregated to various time buckets. Stroom-Stats uses Kafka for ingesting the source data.\nData receipt filtering Data arriving in Stroom has meta data that can be matched against a policy so that certain actions can be taken. This could be to receive, drop or reject the data.\nFiltering of data also applies to Stroom proxy where each proxy can get a filtering policy from an upstream proxy or a Stroom instance.\nData retention policies The length of time that data will be retained in Strooms stream store can be defined by creating data retention rules. These rules match streams based on their meta data and will automatically delete data once the retention period associated with the rule is exceeded.\nDashboard linking Links can be created in dashboards to jump to other dashboards or other external sites that provide additional contextual information.\nSearch API The search system used by Dashboards can be used via a restful API. This provides access to data stored in search indices (including the ability to extract data) and statistics stores. The data fetched via the search API can be received and processed via an external system.\nKafka appender and filter New pipeline elements for writing XML or text data to a Kafka topic. This provides more options for using Stroom’s data in other systems.\n","categories":"","description":"","excerpt":"OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect authentication Authentication for Stroom …","ref":"/stroom-docs/hugo-docsy/news/releases/v06.00/","tags":"","title":"Version 6.0"},{"body":" This is a placeholder page.
